# twitterbot

This is a very simple and fun project. In this project I am using "twit" npm to fetch,post,read,stream of twitter account.

Steps to run this project:-
1. create a developer account on dev.twitter.com
2. Create an instance and fill all the required information
3. download the JSON token.
5. Paste the credential into config.js
6. Run npm install.
7. Except config.js every .js file is independent of each other so you can run anyone like "getAllFollowers.js", "posttwit.js", etc.

Environment:-
1. Node.js
2. windows/linux/mac
